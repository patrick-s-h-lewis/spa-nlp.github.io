## Call for Papers


This workshop aims to invite researchers to share their latest work in designing and understanding semiparametric models. We will welcome papers / work-in-progress on several topics (but not limited to):

1. Understanding properties and capabilities

	* Expressivity of semiparametric models
	* Generalization in low resource settings
	* Quick adaptation to newly emerging phenomena/temporally aware
	* Right to be forgotten/ GDPR /Privacy
	* Interpretability, explainability, and controllability

2. Models that do explicit reasoning with non-parametric components (than implicitly doing in parameters)

	* Case-based reasoning
	* Episodic control
	* On-the-fly Neuro-symbolic Reasoning and Neural Theorem Proving

3. Organizing non-parametric components for efficient use in semi-parametric models

	* Hierarchies/DAGs
	* Incremental Data structures

4. Applications to existing/new tasks

	* QA and Semantic Parsing
	* Structured Prediction
	* Machine Translation
	* Recommender systems
	* Information Retrieval and Extraction
	* New applications

5. Analysis and limitations of current models

	* Faithfulness to the retrieved information
	* How much retrieval is sufficient?
	* Efficiency trade-offs
