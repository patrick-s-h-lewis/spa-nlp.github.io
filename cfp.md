## Call for Papers


This workshop aims to invite researchers to share their latest work in designing and understanding semiparametric models. We will welcome papers / work-in-progress on several topics (but not limited to):

1. Understanding properties and capabilities
	* Expressivity of semiparametric models
	* Generalization in low resource settings
	* Quick adaptation to newly emerging phenomena/temporally aware
	* Right to be forgotten/ GDPR /Privacy
	* Interpretability, explainability, and controllability


2. Models that do explicit reasoning with non-parametric components (than implicitly doing in parameters)
	* Case-based reasoning
	* Episodic control
	* On-the-fly Neuro-symbolic Reasoning and Neural Theorem Proving


3. Organizing non-parametric components for efficient use in semi-parametric models
	* Hierarchies/DAGs
	* Incremental Data structures


4. Applications to existing/new tasks
	* QA and Semantic Parsing
	* Structured Prediction
	* Machine Translation
	* Recommender systems
	* Information Retrieval and Extraction
	* New applications


5. Analysis and limitations of current models
	* Faithfulness to the retrieved information
	* How much retrieval is sufficient?
	* Efficiency trade-offs


We have the archival track as well as the non-archival track. Archival track submissions either go through a standard double-bline review process, or can be submitted with ARR reviews. Non-archival track seeks recently published work---it does not need to be anonymized and will not go through the review process. The submission should clearly indicate the original venue and will be accepted if the organizers think the work will benefit from exposure to the audience of this workshop. Non-archival papers will not be included in the workshop proceedings.

Please see Important Dates for submission deadlines for each track.


## Important Dates

(All AoE)
- Submission deadline: February 28th, 2022
- Notification of acceptance: March 26th, 2022
- Camera-ready paper deadline: April 10th, 2022
- Workshop date: May 26th or 27th, 2022 (TBA)


## Submission guidelines
We seek submissions of original work or work-in-progress. Submissions can be in the form of long/short papers and should follow the ACL main conference template. We will follow double-blind review process. Authors can choose to make their paper non-archival. All accepted papers will be presented at the workshop.


We will use Open Review for the submissions.
