## Overview

**We have released our [Call for Abstracts](cfp)!**

There is growing interest in extracting, representing, and applying knowledge in NLP tasks. Diverse knowledge sources have been explored in the literature, from structured (e.g. Freebase, Wikidata) to unstructured (plain text), and more recently pretrained neural models (e.g. language models). Knowledge from such sources plays an important role in advancing the state-of-the-art in various downstream tasks, such as question answering, text generation and fact verification.

The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in effectively extracting, representing, and applying knowledge in different ways. We promote discussion in related topics including but not limited to:

- The role of explicit structure in representing knowledge in the future.
- Can language models be knowledge bases?
- How to effectively combine structured and unstructured knowledge?
- How to effectively combine external (explicit) and parameterized (implicit) knowledge?
- How to interpret knowledge contained in pretrained models?
- Applications that make use of structured or unstructured knowledge.
- Models which reason over knowledge, e.g. numerical and multi-hop reasoning.
- Transfer learning for diverse knowledge sources.
- Extracting and evaluating knowledge stored in language models.
- Multilingual knowledge sources.

**Due to concerns about COVID-19, Workshop on Unstructured and Structured KBs will be fully virtual.**
