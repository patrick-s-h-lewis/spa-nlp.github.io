## Overview

There is growing interest in extracting, representing, and applying knowledge in NLP tasks. Diverse knowledge sources have been explored in the literature, from structured (e.g. Freebase, Wikidata) to unstructured (plain text), and more recently pretrained neural models (e.g. language models). Knowledge from such sources plays an important role in advancing the state-of-the-art in various downstream tasks, such as question answering, text generation and fact verification.


The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in effectively extracting, representing, and applying knowledge in different ways. We promote discussion in related topics including but not limited to:


- The role of explicit structure in representing knowledge in the future.
- Can language models be knowledge bases?
- How to effectively combine structured and unstructured knowledge?
- How to effectively combine external (explicit) and parameterized (implicit) knowledge?
- How to interpret knowledge contained in pretrained models?
- Applications that make use of structured or unstructured knowledge.
- Models which reason over knowledge, e.g. numerical and multi-hop reasoning.
- Transfer learning for diverse knowledge sources.
- Extracting and evaluating knowledge stored in language models.
- Multilingual knowledge sources.


**Due to concerns about COVID-19, Workshop on Unstructured and Structured KBs will be fully virtual.**

## Call for Abstracts


We welcome submissions of extended abstracts (1 page max) related to the above research areas. Submissions may include previously published results, late-breaking results, and work in progress. Accepted submissions will be featured on the workshop website with a video presentation and announced during the workshop program. The workshop is non-archival, so participants are free to submit their work for publication elsewhere.


To submit an abstract, please send an email to [uskb-workshop@googlegroups.com](mailto:uskb-workshop@googlegroups.com) with the subject line "USKB submission: [TITLE]". Please include:

- Abstract in PDF format (1-page max) as an attachment. Abstracts will be lightly reviewed to ensure that the topic is within the scope of the workshop.
- A full list of authors.

We require each accepted work to provide a recorded video presentation up to 12 minutes in length. We will reach out with video uploading instructions after acceptance notification.


## Important Dates


- Tuesday, August 31th:       Deadline for submission of extended abstracts
- Wednesday, September 15th:  Notification of acceptance
- Friday, October 1st:        Deadline for recorded videos
- Thursday, October 7th:  Workshop date


## Writing guidelines

- These abstracts can be longer than the typical abstracts for a full research paper (max 1 page).
- Figures and tables are allowed, but will count toward the length limit.
- References will not count toward the length limit.
- Abstracts may include work in progress, but should include some preliminary progress rather than a sketch of the idea only.
- Abstracts do not have to be about a single paper; we allow abstracts that summarize a collection of works under a unified theme (e.g., a series of closely-related papers that build on each other or tackle a common problem). 
- For writing examples, see the accepted abstracts from other AKBC workshops in previous years (e.g. [SLKB](https://sites.google.com/view/akbc-sci/home#h.p_gSgV1fypJAMf), [SciNLP](https://scinlp.org/#poster-sessions))
